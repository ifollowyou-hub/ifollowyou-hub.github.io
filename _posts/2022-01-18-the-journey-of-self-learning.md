In the past 10 years, web and development technology has advanced so much.
We've seen huge advances in Javascript (phew) and other languages, the unbelievable spread of social
media, and some decentralization technologies with massive potential (NFT, DAO, Blockchain).

Proportionally, the breadth and efficacy/efficiency of tools one may use to learn
about these technologies has exploded.

While in the past there may have been some significant barriers of entry to the 
tech world, the _only_ two resources someone needs now are ``-time-`` and ``-motivation-``.

For the price of a Five Guys meal, you can most likely find a course for any
technology, and it may even come coupled with any flavor of a second (e.g. Rails+Vue.js).


There has never been a better time to become a developer, and the first step for
anyone should be to discover what methods help them learn best. If you can find
your optimal pace, and a curator/instructor that presents the ideas in a way you
can understand, there's really no limit to your potential. Here are some of my favorites:

* Gary Bernhardt - [Execute Program](https://executeprogram.com){:target="_blank"} - JavaScript & TypeScript
* Wes Bos - [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/){:target="_blank"} - JavaScript & React
* Michael Hartl - [Learn Enough to be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com){:target="_blank"} - Rails & Web Development Beginner
* Git Immersion - [Git Immersion](https://gitimmersion.com){:target="_blank"} - Git Tutorial

I'll update this post from time-to-time with sources as I find them. Next up - 
Smart Contracts and Ethereum/Solana.
