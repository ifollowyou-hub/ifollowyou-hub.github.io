    I'm Daniel, a North Carolina native.
    I started my IT journey like most - on the Helpdesk.
    Then, after growing to a Team Lead I was given the opportunity to tackle some problems
    infinitely more complex than any algorithm - managing people.
    I've learned so much about what motivates people and how to build cohesive teams.
    </p>
    <p>
    Currently, I am dedicated to my professional impact by working with teams to
    build software. <strong>There are few things more inspiring to me than truly improving
      how teams collaborate for a common purpose, and I've found software engineering to be the
      most powerful way to do it.</strong>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      In my spare time, you can find me working on or playing my guitars. I also
      enjoy backpacking and mountain biking.  </p>
