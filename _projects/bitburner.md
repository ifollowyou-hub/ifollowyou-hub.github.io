title: Bitburner (Scripts Only)
---

Bitburner is an open-source game with a futuristic cyberpunk hacking theme.
The game is centered around writing scripts to interact with computers, so
while I am not a maintainer of the game itself, I do have some of my game
scripts available in my public Github. It's a great way to practice JavaScript 
and React.js. As soon as I'm done playing it, I plan on contributing some PR's.
