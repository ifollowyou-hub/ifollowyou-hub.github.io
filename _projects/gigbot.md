My toy app that combines my hobbies. The site allows a user to create and save 
setlists to practice their instrument of choice (heavily favors guitar). Setlists
are built from Youtube videos so the player can organize songs for different purposes.
e.g. "The Man Who Sold The World" can go on my David Bowie setlist AND my 70's rock
setlist.

It uses Rails, React, and Algolia.
